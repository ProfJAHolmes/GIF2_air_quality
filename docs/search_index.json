You will use and build on some of the techniques you learned earlier in the term in this module, and in Term 1 in GEOG0013 Geography in the Field 1. Prof Jonathan A. Holmes Department of Geography | Room 211 NW Wing "],["overview-and-getting-help.html", "1 Overview and getting help", " 1 Overview and getting help Air quality is measured at numerous sites across the UK, using both automated and manual equipment. In the London Brough of Camden, there are two automated stations: Camden Kerbside (latitude/longitude: 51.544210, -0.175269) and London Bloomsbury (51.522290, -0.125889) that form part of the Automatic Urban and Rural Network (AURN). Air-quality data are available from the UK Defra air information resource. The aim of this practical is to undertake statistical analysis of Camden air quality data that you will download from the Defra air information resource. Data analysis will be undertaken using R, which was introduced to you in GEOG0013 in term 1 by Dr Anwar Musah and which you should also have used again in GEOG0014 in a previous practical. Watch the introductory video below before the practical class. If you need a reminder about getting started with R, see Dr Musah’s video ‘Introduction to Statistics’ Part 1 Getting started with R studio’ You may also find it helpful to refer more generally to GEOG0013 tutorials from term 1. The exercises only require you to use base R and you do not need to install any packages, although you are welcome to use packages such as ggplot2 for graphing if you have relevant expertise. There are plenty of opportunities to get help with this exercise if you are stuck First, check the introductory video again to see if this covers your query. Second, you can ask one of the staff or PGTAs during the practical class or the follow-up seminar. Finally, if you have watched the video and attended both of the face-to-face sessions but are still having problems, you can come along to my office hours, but please do not email code that does not work to me, other staff or to the PGTAs expecting us to fix it for you. Video: Introduction to the Air Quality practical (Length: 15 minutes) "],["tasks.html", "2 Tasks 2.1 Data download 2.2 Reading data into R 2.3 Plotting and data analysis", " 2 Tasks The tasks are described below. You should present the results of your calculations and plots, as indicated, together with any comments on the data. Make sure that your comments adhere to the length limits specified. This is an independent piece of work. Although you are welcome to discuss the exercise with your colleagues, all of the analyses, plots and answers to questions should be your own work. 2.1 Data download Download data for the calendar year 2017 from the Defra data selector for both of the Camden monitoring stations by clicking here First, select ‘Search hourly networks’ and then, for the various options, choose as follows: data type = daily mean; date range = the year in question, monitoring sites = local authority and then London Borough of Camden (choose Camden Kerbside and London Bloomsbury from the list) select pollutants = by monitoring network and AURN and then select the following two variables from the drop-down list: PM10 particulate matter (hourly measured) and PM2.5 Particulate matter (hourly measured). You can either chose to view the data on screen and then copy and paste them into excel OR have the data emailed to you as a csv file. Note that the email option has not been working so copying and pasting from the on-screen option into a csv file may be best. If you do chose this option however, make sure that the data from the two sites appear in separate columns in your csv file. Once the file has been received or created, save it onto your N:/ drive (or your desktop if using your own computer). Before reading the dataset into R, you will need to perform a basic clean-up to replace the entry in those cells for which there are no values (marked ‘No data’) with empty cells, using the search and replace function in excel. 2.2 Reading data into R Read the cleaned data file into R using the read.csv command, skipping the first four lines (which contain neither the column headings nor values). Then create a new dataset comprising only the date column and the columns containing values (i.e. omit the columns labelled ‘status’). This dataset is used for all subsequent analyses described below. 2.3 Plotting and data analysis 2.3.1 Descriptive statistics [25 marks in total] Calculate the mean and standard deviation for PM10 and PM2.5 for both sites: calculate the mean and standard deviation for the entire year first of all, and then for each quarter. Present these values in a simple table. For the air pollution data, how well do the annual parameters summarise the datasets? Do you see differences between the four quarters? If so, how might these be explained? [5 lines] 2.3.2 Time-series plot [25 marks in total] Produce two time-series plots for Camden Kerbside, one for PM10 and a second for PM2.5. Make sure that you label the x-axis with the date, and the y axis with the name of the variable and the units of measurement. Comment briefly on the variations in the variable. How similar are the time series for the two variables? [5 lines] 2.3.3 Difference between sites [25 marks in total] You will now investigate further any differences or similarities between the two Camden sites, using either PM10 or PM2.5 (you only need to make one plot). First, plot the data for the two sites on a bivariate scatter plot, clearly noting which axis represents which site by appropriate labelling. Then fit a linear regression line through the dataset. Give the regression equation for the regression line and calculate the correlation coefficient between the two variables. Comment critically on the findings [5 lines] 2.3.4 Difference between the two variables [25 marks in total] You will now investigate the relationship between the two variables (PM10 and PM2.5) for one of the sites. For either Camden Kerbside or London Bloomsbury, plot PM10 and PM2.5 on a bivariate scatter plot, clearly noting which axis represents which variable by appropriate labelling and indicating which site you have chosen in the plot title. Then fit a linear regression line through the dataset. Give the regression equation for the regression line and calculate the correlation coefficient between the two variables. Comment critically on the findings [5 lines] "],["what-to-hand-in.html", "3 What to hand in", " 3 What to hand in You should hand in the graphs, results of statistical tests and answers to questions, as noted above, in a single document that has 2 cm margins all round and does not exceed 2 A4 pages in length. Graphs and tables should be appropriately titled, labelled and scaled: they should be large enough to be legible but not excessively large. Answers to the questions should be in minimum 11pt Times or Arial and should adhere to the line limits stated above. Any text that exceeds these limits will be disregarded and not marked. Your file should be submitted anonymously using the turnitin link on the course moodle page entitled worksheet number 2. Make sure you follow exactly the submission instructions on moodle.

You should present the results of your calculations and plots, as indicated, together with any comments on the data. Make sure that your comments adhere to the length limits specified. This is an independent piece of work. Although you are welcome to discuss the exercise with your colleagues, all of the analyses, plots and answers to questions should be your own work. 2.1 Data download Download data for the calendar year 2020 from the Defra data selector for both of the Camden monitoring stations by clicking here For the various options, choose as follows: data type = daily mean; date range = the year in question, monitoring sites = local authority and then London Borough of Camden, select pollutants = by monitoring network and AURN and then select the following two variables from the drop-down list: PM10 particulate matter (hourly measured) and PM2.5 Particulate matter (hourly measured). Finally, choose to have the data emailed to you as a csv file. Once received, save the file onto your N:/ drive. Before reading the dataset into R, you will need to perform a basic clean-up to replace the entry in those cells for which there are no values (marked ‘No data’) with empty cells, using the search and replace function in excel. 2.2 Reading data into R Read the cleaned data file into R using the read.csv command, skipping the first four lines (which contain neither the column headings nor values). Then create a new dataset comprising only the date column and the columns containing values (i.e. omit the columns labelled ‘status’). This dataset is used for all subsequent analyses in 1 to 4 below.
